# Terminal Chaos - Task Writeup

## Overview

"Terminal Chaos" is an interactive task that familiarized me with basic terminal and git commands through a series of challenges. The journey spanned across different realms, requiring me to use commands like `ls`, `cd`, `cat`, `grep`, and `git checkout` to explore, collect hidden codes, and navigate between branches.

## Part 1: Exploring Arrakis-dex

- Started by navigating directories using `ls` and `cd` commands.
- Discovered a hidden parchment using enhanced `ls` and `find` commands.
- Read the parchmentâ€™s content with `cat` and saved the code in the Handbook.

## Part 2: Switching Realms

- Used `git checkout` to switch between branches representing different realms.
- Fought through hostile environments and found hidden artifacts and codes using `grep` and other search commands.
- Crafted a holy spell by processing file contents and performing text manipulation.

## Part 3: Conquering the Dark Realm

- Entered the Dark Realm and unlocked chests using the Celestial Veil Amulet.
- Gathered hidden codes from two separate dark branches.

## Part 4: Uniting the Fragments

- Combined all acquired codes to form a final key, leading to the GodSuite repository.
- Cloned the repository to proceed to the final task.

## Part 5: GodSuite Repository

- Analyzed commit histories to find the secret code embedded in the changes.
- Decoded the final key to complete the task.

## Reflection

This task was a creative and challenging way to deepen my understanding of terminal and git commands. Navigating the narrative while solving problems step-by-step made it both engaging and rewarding.
