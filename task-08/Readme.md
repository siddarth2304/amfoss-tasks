README Documentation 

For anyone interested in trying out TerminalTrolly, I’ve made sure that the README in my GitHub repository is as straightforward as possible. Here’s what you’ll find:



•Introduction: A brief overview of what TerminalTrolly is and what it does.

•How to Install: Step-by-step instructions on setting up the project.

•How to Use: Detailed examples of commands and their functions.

•Features: A list of the key features I implemented, along with explanations.

•Screenshots: Some visuals to help you understand what to expect.

•Tech Details: A breakdown of the tools and technologies I used, plus some of the challenges I faced.

•Credits: Shoutouts to anyone or anything that helped along the way.

•Contact: If you have questions or feedback, my contact info is there too.

•I hope this blog and the README inspire someone to give TerminalTrolly a shot—or at least to think twice about how much can be accomplished right from the command line.
