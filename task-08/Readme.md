# TerminalTrolly

## Introduction

When I first heard about the TerminalTrolly challenge, I wasn't sure what to expect. A terminal-based hypermarket? It sounded both intriguing and a bit daunting. But as someone who's always up for a good challenge, I dove right in. What followed was a mix of frustration, late-night coding sessions, and eventually, a deep sense of accomplishment.

## The Challenge

### Navigating the Store
The first hurdle was figuring out how to move around the terminal-based store. The products were all listed in a text format, and I had to use basic commands to browse through them. This part really made me appreciate how much we take GUIs for granted. Here, every little move required a command.

### Sorting and Searching
Once I got the hang of navigating, I realized that finding specific products was like searching for a needle in a haystack. That's when I implemented `sort` and `search` functions. These allowed me to quickly find what I was looking for, whether by price, category, or name. Writing the scripts for these commands was both fun and challenging, as I had to juggle different string manipulations and ensure everything worked smoothly.

### Buying Products
The `buy` command was another beast altogether. I needed to make sure that once you decided to purchase something, the terminal would redirect you to a checkout page. This part involved dealing with redirections and making sure that all the data—like selected items—was carried over correctly.

### Handling Errors
I also had to think about what would happen if someone made a typo or tried to do something that wasn’t allowed. Implementing error handling made me realize how important it is to anticipate all the ways things can go wrong, especially when there’s no “undo” button in the terminal.

## Why This Task Was Special

I’ve worked on various projects, but TerminalTrolly stands out because it took me out of my comfort zone. I’m used to coding, but doing everything through a terminal without the safety net of a visual interface was a whole new experience. It forced me to think differently about user interaction and how to make a text-based experience as intuitive as possible.

There were moments of frustration, especially when a script wouldn’t work the way I wanted it to, but those moments were balanced by the sheer satisfaction of seeing everything come together. It was also a great way to brush up on my Bash scripting and Linux command-line skills—tools that are often overlooked but incredibly powerful.

## Final Thoughts

If I had to sum up my experience with TerminalTrolly in one word, it would be "rewarding." It was a task that pushed me, taught me, and reminded me why I love coding in the first place. The challenge of creating a seamless shopping experience in a terminal environment was unlike anything I’d done before, and I’m proud of what I accomplished.
