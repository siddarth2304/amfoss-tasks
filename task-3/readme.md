# Task 03 - Multi-Language Programming Challenges

This task demonstrates fundamental programming concepts in various languages, including Python, Ruby, Elixir, JavaScript, Java, Go, C, C++, Rust, and Haskell. The task is divided into four sub-tasks implemented in all these languages.

## Sub-Tasks Overview

1. **Hello, World!**
   - A simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

2. **File Input/Output**
   - Reads a string from `input.txt` and writes it to `output.txt`.

3. **Diamond Pattern (Console Output)**
   - Prompts the user to input a number `n` and generates a diamond pattern of asterisks (`*`) in the console.

4. **Diamond Pattern (File Input/Output)**
   - Reads a number `n` from `input.txt` and generates a diamond pattern of asterisks (`*`) in `output.txt`.


Completing this task was both challenging and rewarding. Tackling the same problems in multiple languages pushed me to adapt quickly and deepen my understanding of each language's unique characteristics.
